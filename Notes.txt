Git and GitHub

-Git and GitHub are separate
-Git is a version control system (VCS)
-Git commands can be typed directly into terminal
    -git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    -git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
        These commands are so git can show the name/email of the person who made the change on the .git file.
    -git init is the command to create a hidden .git file that will track the project
        (must make sure you are in the parent/project folder you want to track).
    -git status shows the branch, commits and untracked files
    -git add XXXXXXX.xxx will add an existing file to the staging area of Git
    -git commit -m "Your Commit Message" will commit the changes
    -git log shows a history of commits
    -git add . will add everything in the staging area


Useful Terminal Commands (Mac)

ls -a : list files, including hidden ones (useful to verify .git file was created)
-touch XXXXXXX.xxx creates a file
